# What is it that you are exploring:
- Here im exploring the Economy and growth topic and different indicators which plays a major role in countries economic growth.
# Why is it important to you and/or to others?:
- Today's world business Economic growth is the major factor for development of contry in all the aspects. with the increase in Economic growth of government there will be increase in purchasing power parity of it's people, which inturn agian incraeses the countries economic activity.  
- Economic Growth is important because it is the means by which we can improve the quality of our standard of living. Economic growth increases state capacity and the supply of public goods. Growth creates wealth, some of which goes directly into the pockets of employers and workers, improving their wellbeing. As people earn higher incomes and spend more money, this enables people to exit poverty and gain improved living standards.
# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
- Here I want to find out how different sectors will contribution to the country's GDP and in which sectors governments should focus for increasing their countires GDP.

# Introduction:
- Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy. Economic growth is commonly measured in terms of the increase in aggregated market value of additional goods and services produced, using estimates such as GDP. Major sectors involving in most of the countries economy are manufacturing sector, agricultural sector, industrial sector and service sector. Here im taking important indicators in the above mentioned sectors to analyze the what percentage of contribution they are generating in countries Economy and growth. 
# Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) contribution to Economy growth:
 ![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/Goods%20and%20services.png)
 - From this graph we can observe that Switzerland is getting high economy from Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) than the remaining choosen countries
 - And India is getting low economy from choosen countries.
# Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) contribution to Economy growth:
 ![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/Agriculture.png)
 -  From this graph we can observe that India's (Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)) is higher than remaining countries.
 -  United kingdom is getting less economy from (Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)).
# Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) contribution to Economy growth:
 ![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/industry.png)
 - From here we can observe that all the choosen countries are getting around 25% income from Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) except United Kingdom which is getting around 18% from industrial sector.
# Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP) contribution to Economy growth:
 ![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/manufacturing.png)
 - From this graph we can observe that Switzerland is getting high economy from Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP)
  than remaining choosen countries.
 - And Australia is getting low economy growth from Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP).
# Trade in services (% of GDP) contribution to Economy growth:
 ![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/trade.png)
- If we observe this sector all the choosen countries Trade in services (% of GDP) contribution to the economy increased from 2010-2018, Switzerland is having highest percentage of contribution from Trade in services (% of GDP) compared to other countries.

# GDP per capita, PPP (current international $):
![](https://github.com/rakeshp1/world_development_explorer/blob/main/graphs/GDP.png)
- From this Pie chart we can observe that Switzerland is having highest percentage of GDP with 37.9% and india is having lowest percentage of GDP with 3.53%.
# Conclusion:
- From the above graphs we can conclude the following observations.
# Switzerland:
- Economic growth from Exports of goods and services (% of GDP),  Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP)& Trade in services (% of GDP) of Switzerland is higher than the choosen countires and it is getting less economy from Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) and  Switzerland is getting equal percentage of income from Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) along with the choosen countries except UK which is 7% lesser than Switzerland. with all these in account Switzerland is having highest % of GDP with 37.9%.
# India:
- India is getting high economy from Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP), and getting equal % of economy from Industry (including construction),value added (% of GDP)  along with the choosen countries. Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) contribution to india's economy is low among all. with all these indicators keeping in mind if we observe the GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) value of india is lowest among all with 3.53%. From this we can conclude one important factor is although india is having highest percentage of economy from  Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) still India is having less GDP per capita, PPP (current international $). what i observed from this analysis is that  Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) plays a major role in India's economic growth.
# Australia:
- Economic growth of Australia from Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) is high compared with choosen countries and economic growth from remaining indicators Exports of goods and services (% of GDP),Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP) & Trade in services (% of GDP) of Australia are not doing significantly great. but still Australia is having 26.6% of GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) from choosen countries. From this what i observed is Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) is playing a major role in Australia Economic growth.
# United Kingdom:
-  United Kingdom is doing well after Switzerland in Exports of goods and services (% of GDP),Trade in services (% of GDP). and Economy from Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) & Manufacturing, value added (% of GDP) is not high. Though United Kingdom manages to have an 25% of GDP per capita, PPP (current international $).From this we can conclude that Exports of goods and services (% of GDP),Trade in services (% of GDP) are the major factors for United Kingdom economic growth.
# Sri Lanka:
- Economic growth from Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) of Sri Lanka is second in the list after india, and remaining indicators also if we observe Sri Lanka is gradually improving in  Trade in services (% of GDP) from 2014 and also in Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) is going better than india. at the same time Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP) of Sri Lanka is on far with india. with all these factors in mind Sri Lanka is having 6.97% of  GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) which is higher than india's  GDP per capita, PPP (current international $). From this what im assuming is population is also plays a major role in countries Economic growth.

- Finally with all the above information what i understood is, Economic growth of a country is not completely dependent on all of the above mentioned indicators Few countires depend on only few indicators and few countires dependent on all indicators, as we have seen in australia scenario it's Economic activity depended more on Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP). To completely understand the countries Economic growth we need more indicators like population count, employement rate,education...etc.and i believe population count impacts more on the GDP per capita, PPP (current international $). Because even though if a country has significant Economic growth in the last decade and at the same time having higher population count does not make significant improvement in the GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) of that country.
